Bellabeat Case Study for Google Capstone Project

Purpose:
Hello, everyone, I have been doing the Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate through Coursera for the past few months. This is the course's last capstone project for me. In this case study, I will be examining a public dataset for Bellabeat, a wellness technology startup, which was provided by the course. I will be emulating a few of the actual duties of a junior data analyst in this case study.
